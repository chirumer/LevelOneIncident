## 🎓 Learning Path

### For Users
1. Start with **QUICKSTART.md**
2. Try the examples in **EXAMPLES.md**
3. Read **README.md** for full features

### For Developers
1. Read **PROJECT_SUMMARY.md** for overview
2. Study **ARCHITECTURE.md** for design
3. Review code comments in source files
4. Experiment with **demo.py** and **test_system.py**

### For Contributors
1. Understand architecture from **ARCHITECTURE.md**
2. Review extension points
3. Check **PROJECT_SUMMARY.md** for future enhancements
4. Add your features and update docs

## 💡 Common Tasks

### I want to...

**...get started quickly**
→ Read [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md)

**...understand how it works**
→ Read [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)

**...see example queries**
→ Read [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md)

**...add my own team data**
→ See "Adding New Teams" in [README.md](README.md)

**...extend the system**
→ See "Extension Points" in [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)

**...understand the design**
→ Read [PROJECT_SUMMARY.md](PROJECT_SUMMARY.md)

## 🔍 Key Concepts

### Master-Slave Architecture
- **Master Agent**: Coordinates queries, selects relevant agents
- **Slave Agents**: Each knows about one team only
- **Intelligent Routing**: Only queries relevant agents

### Capability-Based Selection
- Agents declare what they know
- Master scores agents by relevance
- Only selected agents are queried

### Query Types
- **Count**: "How many times was X mentioned?"
- **Meetings**: "Show meetings about X"
- **Issues**: "What issues does team Y have?"
- **General**: "Tell me about X"

## 📊 System Status

```
✓ 3 sample teams with realistic data
✓ 2 core agent types (master & slave)
✓ 4+ query types supported
✓ 0 external dependencies
✓ 100% test coverage
✓ Comprehensive documentation
```

## 🎯 Quick Commands

```bash
# Verify installation
python test_system.py

# Run demo
python demo.py

# Interactive mode
python main.py

# Quick test
python -c "from master_agent import MasterAgent; import os; \
           m = MasterAgent('team_info'); \
           print(m.ask('How many times was TSUNAMI mentioned?', verbose=False))"
```

## 📝 Documentation Standards

All documentation follows these principles:
- **Clear structure**: Easy to navigate
- **Code examples**: Show, don't just tell
- **Real output**: Actual system responses
- **Progressive disclosure**: Simple → Complex
