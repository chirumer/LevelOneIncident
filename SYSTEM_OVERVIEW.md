# System Overview: Incident Response Coordination Platform

## 🎯 What Was Built

A complete **multi-agent incident response coordination system** with:
- Autonomous team agents that propose tasks
- Master coordinator that creates prioritized assignments
- Interactive task dependency graph visualization
- Beautiful web interface with real-time updates

## 🏗️ Architecture

### The Flow

```
1. USER REPORTS INCIDENT
   ↓
   "Production database outage - authentication down"
   Deadline: 12 hours
   
2. MASTER AGENT COORDINATES
   ↓
   Asks each team: "How can you help resolve this?"
   
3. TEAMS PROPOSE TASKS
   ↓
   Backend Team:
   - Check server health (Priority: 9)
   - Restart services (Priority: 10)
   - Scale resources (Priority: 8)
   
   Security Team:
   - Security audit (Priority: 7)
   - Review logs (Priority: 6)
   
   Frontend Team:
   - User notification (Priority: 4)
   
4. GRAPH CREATION
   ↓
   Each task → incident edge (weighted by priority)
   Task dependencies shown as edges
   
5. ASSIGNMENT PRIORITIZATION
   ↓
   Tasks sorted by importance
   Grouped by team
   
6. WEB VISUALIZATION
   ↓
   Interactive graph + Styled tables
```

## 📊 Key Components

### 1. Incident Slave Agent (`incident_slave_agent.py`)

**Purpose**: Represents a team and proposes tasks for incidents

**Key Features**:
- Analyzes incident relevance to team expertise
- Generates tasks based on incident type
- Assigns importance weights (1-10 scale)
- Sets tentative deadlines
- Identifies task dependencies

**Expertise Areas**:
- Security
- Frontend
- Backend
- Infrastructure
- Database
- Performance
- Monitoring

**Example Output**:
```python
{
    "task_id": "Backend_Infrastructure_Team_INFRA_01",
    "description": "Check server health and resource utilization",
    "importance": 9,
    "estimated_hours": 2,
    "tentative_deadline": "2024-10-23 00:00:00",
    "assigned_to": "Robert Zhang",
    "dependencies": []
}
```

### 2. Incident Master Agent (`incident_master_agent.py`)

**Purpose**: Coordinates all teams and creates visualizations

**Key Responsibilities**:
1. Collect task proposals from all teams
2. Build task dependency graph
3. Create prioritized assignments
4. Generate HTML visualizations

**Graph Structure**:
```python
{
    "nodes": [
        {"id": "INCIDENT", "type": "incident", "importance": 10},
        {"id": "TASK_1", "type": "task", "importance": 9},
        ...
    ],
    "edges": [
        {"from": "TASK_1", "to": "INCIDENT", "weight": 9},
        {"from": "TASK_2", "to": "TASK_1", "type": "dependency"},
        ...
    ]
}
```

**Assignment Structure**:
```python
{
    "team_name": "Backend Infrastructure Team",
    "task_count": 5,
    "total_estimated_hours": 18,
    "average_importance": 8.4,
    "tasks": [...]  # Sorted by importance
}
```

### 3. Web Server (`web_server.py`)

**Purpose**: Serve web interface with visualizations

**Features**:
- HTTP server on localhost:8000
- Incident creation form
- Real-time graph rendering (vis.js)
- Styled assignment tables
- Responsive design

**Endpoints**:
- `GET /` - Main page
- `POST /api/create_incident` - Create incident
- `GET /api/incident` - Get current incident
- `GET /api/teams` - Get team info

## 🎨 Visualizations

### Task Dependency Graph

**Technology**: vis.js network visualization

**Features**:
- Hierarchical layout (incident at top)
- Color-coded by importance
- Interactive zoom/pan
- Edge weights show priority
- Dependency edges (dashed)

**Appearance**:
- Incident node: Red/pink, ellipse
- Task nodes: Blue gradient (darker = higher priority)
- Task→Incident edges: Solid, width = importance
- Task→Task edges: Dashed green (dependencies)

### Assignment Tables

**Features**:
- Grouped by team
- Sorted by priority within team
- Color-coded badges
- Team statistics header
- Responsive design

**Priority Colors**:
- 🔴 HIGH (8-10): Red badge
- 🟡 MEDIUM (5-7): Orange badge
- 🟢 LOW (1-4): Green badge

## 📈 How Teams Decide Tasks

### Relevance Calculation

```python
score = 0

# Team name mentioned
if team_name in incident:
    score += 20

# Expertise match
for expertise in team_expertise:
    if expertise in incident:
        score += 10

# Specific keywords
if "outage" in incident and "infrastructure" in expertise:
    score += 15
```

### Task Generation

Based on relevance score and expertise:

**High Relevance (20+)**:
- 4-6 tasks
- Priority: 8-11
- Includes critical and supporting tasks

**Medium Relevance (10-19)**:
- 2-3 tasks
- Priority: 5-8
- Focused on specific expertise

**Low Relevance (1-9)**:
- 1 task
- Priority: 1-3
- General monitoring/support

## 🔧 Customization Points

### Add New Expertise Area

In `incident_slave_agent.py`:
```python
expertise_keywords = {
    'your_area': ['keyword1', 'keyword2', 'keyword3']
}
```

### Add New Task Type

In `incident_slave_agent.py`:
```python
def _generate_your_tasks(self, incident, deadline, base_importance):
    tasks = []
    if 'your_keyword' in incident.lower():
        tasks.append({
            "task_id": f"{self.team_name}_YOUR_01",
            "description": "Your task description",
            "importance": base_importance + 3,
            ...
        })
    return tasks
```

### Customize Graph Appearance

In `incident_master_agent.py`, modify `generate_graph_html()`:
```python
options = {
    'nodes': {
        'shape': 'box',  # or 'ellipse', 'circle', etc.
        'color': {...}
    },
    'edges': {
        'color': {...}
    }
}
```

### Customize Table Styling

In `incident_master_agent.py`, modify `generate_assignments_html()`:
```python
.team-header {
    background: 'your-gradient';
    color: 'your-color';
}
```
