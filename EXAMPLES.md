# Usage Examples

This document shows real examples of how the system works with actual output.

## Example 1: Counting Mentions

### Query
```
"How many times was TSUNAMI mentioned?"
```

### What Happens

**Step 1: Master Agent Analyzes Query**
```
Keywords extracted: ['TSUNAMI', 'times', 'count']
Query type: COUNT
```

**Step 2: Agent Selection**
```
Scoring agents...
  ‚Ä¢ TSUNAMI Response Team: 20 points (has topic:TSUNAMI)
  ‚Ä¢ Backend Infrastructure Team: 10 points (mentions TSUNAMI)
  ‚Ä¢ Frontend Development Team: 0 points (no TSUNAMI content)

Selected: 2 agents
```

**Step 3: Querying Selected Agents**
```
Querying: TSUNAMI Response Team...
  Result: 15 mentions

Querying: Backend Infrastructure Team...
  Result: 8 mentions
```

**Step 4: Aggregation**
```
Total: 15 + 8 = 23 mentions
Teams with mentions: 2
```

### Output
```
================================================================================
MASTER AGENT: Final Answer
================================================================================

Count Results:
  ‚Ä¢ 'TSUNAMI' mentioned 23 times across all teams

Teams with mentions: 2

================================================================================

## Example 2: Finding Meetings

### Query
```
"Show me all meetings related to TSUNAMI"
```

### What Happens

**Step 1: Agent Selection**
```
Selected agents (by relevance):

     Matching capabilities: topic:TSUNAMI, has:meetings
  2. Backend Infrastructure Team (score: 10)
     Matching capabilities: topic:TSUNAMI, has:meetings
```

**Step 2: Each Agent Searches Its Meetings**

## Tips for Better Results

### ‚úÖ Good Queries
```
"How many times was TSUNAMI mentioned?"          # Specific term
"Show meetings about security"                   # Clear topic
"What is the Frontend team working on?"          # Specific team
"List all high priority issues"                  # Clear criteria
```

### ‚ùå Less Effective Queries
```
"Tell me everything"                             # Too broad
"What's happening?"                              # No context
"Show me stuff"                                  # Vague
```

### üí° Pro Tips

1. **Use specific terms**: Team names, issue IDs, topics
2. **Be clear about what you want**: count, list, show, find
3. **Include context**: time periods, priorities, statuses
4. **Try variations**: If you don't get what you want, rephrase
