```

## üöÄ How to Use

### Quick Start
```bash
# Test the system
python test_system.py

# Run demo
python demo.py

# Interactive mode
python main.py
```

### Example Queries
```
"How many times was TSUNAMI mentioned?"
"Show me all meetings related to TSUNAMI"
"What issues does the Frontend team have?"
"List all high priority tickets"
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Highlights

### Slave Agents
- **One agent per team** - Each knows only about its team
- **Self-identifying** - Declares what information it can provide
- **Capability-based** - Identifies topics, data sources, and content types

### Master Agent
- **Intelligent routing** - Selects only relevant agents for each query
- **Scoring system** - Ranks agents by relevance (0-50+ points)
- **Aggregation** - Combines results from multiple agents
- **Smart formatting** - Presents results in human-readable format

### Selection Algorithm
```python
For each query:
  1. Extract keywords (TSUNAMI, team names, etc.)
  2. Score all agents based on capability matches
  3. Select agents with score > 0
  4. Query selected agents in parallel (conceptually)
  5. Aggregate and format results
```

## üí° Key Features

### ‚úÖ Intelligent Agent Selection
The master agent doesn't query all agents for every question. It analyzes the query and selects only relevant agents.

**Example**: Query "What is the Frontend team doing?"
- ‚úì Selects: Frontend Development Team (score: 20)
- ‚úó Skips: TSUNAMI Response Team (score: 0)
- ‚úó Skips: Backend Infrastructure Team (score: 0)

### ‚úÖ Capability-Based Routing
Each agent declares what it knows:
```python
capabilities = [
    "team:TSUNAMI Response Team",
    "topic:TSUNAMI",
    "topic:SECURITY",
    "source:jira",
    "source:confluence",
    "has:meetings"
]
```

### ‚úÖ Flexible Query Types
- **Count queries**: "How many times was X mentioned?"
- **Meeting queries**: "Show meetings about X"
- **Issue queries**: "What issues does team Y have?"
- **General queries**: "Tell me about X"

### ‚úÖ Easy Extensibility
- Add new team: Just create a `.txt` file
- Add new query type: Extend `answer_query()` method
- Add new capability: Modify `_identify_capabilities()`

## üé® Design Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Slave agents know nothing about other teams
2. **Intelligent Routing**: Don't waste computation on irrelevant agents
3. **Scalability**: Easy to add new teams without code changes
4. **No Dependencies**: Built with Python standard library only

## üìä Sample Output

```
================================================================================
MASTER AGENT: Processing query
================================================================================
Query: How many times was TSUNAMI mentioned?

Agent Selection Process:
  ‚Ä¢ Analyzed 3 available agents
  ‚Ä¢ Selected 2 relevant agents

Selected Agents (by relevance):
  1. TSUNAMI Response Team (score: 20)
     Matching capabilities: topic:TSUNAMI
  2. Backend Infrastructure Team (score: 10)
     Matching capabilities: topic:TSUNAMI

Querying: TSUNAMI Response Team...
  ‚úì Response received

Querying: Backend Infrastructure Team...
  ‚úì Response received

================================================================================
MASTER AGENT: Final Answer
================================================================================

Count Results:
  ‚Ä¢ 'TSUNAMI' mentioned 23 times across all teams

Teams with mentions: 2

================================================================================
```

## üß™ Testing

All tests pass successfully:
```
‚úì Master agent initialization
‚úì Agent identity verification
‚úì Count query processing
‚úì Meeting query processing
‚úì Intelligent agent selection
```

Run tests: `python test_system.py`

## üîß Customization Options

### Add New Teams
1. Create `team_info/your_team.txt`
2. Follow the format in existing files
3. Restart the system

### Add New Query Types
1. Add method in `slave_agent.py`: `_find_your_type()`
2. Update `answer_query()` to route to new method
3. Update `_aggregate_results()` in `master_agent.py`

### Customize Scoring
Modify `_score_agent_relevance()` in `master_agent.py`:
```python
def _score_agent_relevance(self, agent, query, keywords):
    score = 0
    # Your custom scoring logic
    if 'priority' in query:
        score += 30
    return score, matching
```

## üìà Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Parallel Querying**: Use asyncio for concurrent agent queries
2. **Caching**: Cache frequently asked questions
3. **NLP**: Better query understanding with spaCy or transformers
4. **Web Interface**: REST API + React frontend
5. **Database Support**: Connect to SQL/NoSQL databases
6. **Real-time Updates**: Watch for file changes
7. **Machine Learning**: Learn from query patterns

### Easy Wins
- Add more sample team data
- Implement query history
- Add export functionality (JSON, CSV)
- Create visualization of agent selection

## üéì Learning Outcomes

This project demonstrates:
- **Multi-agent systems** - Coordination between autonomous agents
- **Intelligent routing** - Capability-based agent selection
- **Information retrieval** - Searching and aggregating data
- **Clean architecture** - Separation of concerns, extensibility
- **Python best practices** - Type hints, docstrings, error handling

## üìù Technical Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.8+
- **Dependencies**: None (standard library only!)
- **Architecture**: Master-Slave Agent Pattern
- **Data Format**: Plain text files
- **Parsing**: Regular expressions

## ‚ú® Highlights

### What Makes This Special?

1. **Zero Dependencies**: Works with just Python standard library
2. **Smart Routing**: Doesn't waste computation on irrelevant data
3. **Self-Organizing**: Agents identify their own capabilities
4. **Easy to Extend**: Add teams without touching code
5. **Production-Ready**: Includes tests, docs, and examples

### Real-World Applications

This architecture can be adapted for:
- **Customer support**: Route queries to relevant knowledge bases
- **Documentation search**: Find information across multiple docs
- **Code search**: Query different repositories intelligently
- **Research**: Aggregate information from multiple sources
- **Business intelligence**: Query different data sources

## üéâ Success Metrics

- ‚úÖ All tests passing
- ‚úÖ 3 sample teams with realistic data
- ‚úÖ Intelligent agent selection working
- ‚úÖ Multiple query types supported
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive documentation
- ‚úÖ Easy to use and extend

## ü§ù Next Steps

1. **Try it out**: Run `python main.py`
2. **Add your data**: Create team files with your actual data
3. **Customize**: Extend with your own query types
4. **Scale**: Add more teams and see how it handles
5. **Enhance**: Implement the future enhancements
